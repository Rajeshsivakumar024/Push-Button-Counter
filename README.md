## Description
This project counts the number of times a push button is pressed and shows the count using an LED or Serial Monitor. It was developed as part of my Embedded Systems Internship at Elite Tech Intern.

## Components Used
- PIC16F877A Microcontroller
- Push Button
- Resistors
- LED
- MPLAB X IDE

## Circuit Diagram

## Code
See [main.c](main.c)

## Working
Each press of the button increases the counter by 1. The count is either shown through LED blinks or displayed via UART.
